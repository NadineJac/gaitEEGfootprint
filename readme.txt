This folder contains the analysis pipeline for the manuscript "A walk in the park? Characterizing gait-related artifacts in mobile EEG recordings" (under review, link will be added upon publication).

Start in the footprint_master.m file, which contains the order of called scripts to preprocess the EEG data and to calculate the gait-related artifact footprint before and after.
Success of the artifact reduction will be assessed by sensitivity (proposed footprint) and specificity measures (button-press ERPs).
The data will be made available shortly, and the respective link will by added here.
In the meantime, you can use the scripts with tha data of 3 participants vailable in data.zip (store the folder code in the folder data)
